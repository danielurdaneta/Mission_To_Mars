# Mission_To_Mars

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project was to scrape data from different web pages and then create our own page to display the extracted data, we did it using Python libraries like Beatiful Soup, keeping the extracted data with MongoDB and designing our web application using Html and Bootstrap. We collected the latest news from NASA, with a featured image and table of contents, as well as images of the hemispheres of Mars.

## Results

Another feature is that we created the "Scrape New Data" button, with it we can scrape the latest news from NASA in the future and have an updated web application:
